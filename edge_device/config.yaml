# Edge Device Configuration for Raspberry Pi 2
# License Plate Detection System

# Model Configuration
model:
  path: "models/license_plate_detection.onnx"  # Path to detection model
  img_size: 640  # Input image size
  confidence_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum confidence for detection

# Server Configuration
server:
  url: "https://mytelu.farhanlhsn.web.id"  # Replace with your server URL
  timeout: 10  # Request timeout in seconds

# Camera Configuration
camera:
  index: 1  # Camera device index (0 for default camera)
  width: 1280  # Camera capture width (increased for better quality)
  height: 720  # Camera capture height (increased for better quality)
  process_every_n_frames: 10  # Process every Nth frame (higher quality, less frequent)
  show_preview: true  # Set to true for debugging (disable on headless Raspberry Pi)

# Debug Configuration
debug:
  save_images: false  # Save original and preprocessed plate images for analysis
  
# Logging
logging:
  level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  save_detections: true  # Save detected plate images
  detections_dir: "detections"  # Directory for saved images

# Gate Configuration
gate:
  type: "MASUK"  # MASUK or KELUAR - determines which gate this device controls
  parkiran_id: 1  # ID of the parkiran this gate belongs to
  open_duration: 5  # Seconds to keep gate open after successful detection

# GPIO Configuration (for real gate control on Raspberry Pi)
gpio:
  enabled: false  # Set to true when using real GPIO on Raspberry Pi
  relay_pin: 17   # GPIO pin for relay/servo control
